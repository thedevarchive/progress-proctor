# About

*"The journey of a thousand lines of code begins with a single 'Hello World'."*

Server for the app ![CodeProctor](https://github.com/thedevarchive/code-proctor/tree/main).

This project was made so that I can get started on learning MERN with MongoDB instead of MySQL (finally).

# How to Use

Make sure you have a MongoDB account. Then, create a database that supports the users schema as described in the `User.js` file.

Go to the Command Line or Terminal and type 

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server by typing

```bash
nodemon
```

Then, run the CodeProctor project. 

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js` (and all other `page.js` files in other locations). The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
